              When you go to a pharmacy, you go and pick up your prescription. Maybe you complain about your co-pay, but you buy the medicine, go home, and take it. You're not thinking about what's in it, you usually don't think about it working as promised, and you certainly don't think if it has any malign substances inside. Why is that? The FDA.
              <br><br>
              What is the FDA's job? A good first guess would be to approve and reject drugs/devices - but that would be only ~80% right. The job of the FDA is to lend legitimacy to pharmaceutical companies and by proxy, their products. Its authority comes from a few places: First (and most importantly), it is a government entity - It has a direct mandate to act from the people it affects via democratic processes. Second, it has the power not just to approve products, but also reject them. It has a defined, consistent process by which private entities (pharmaceutical manufacturers) can access its authority, but what gives those entities' products legitimacy is the fact that the FDA can pull the plug if the rules aren't followed. Using this accessed authority, pharmaceutical manufacturers can convey the legitimacy of their products subconsciously to consumers, giving them a tremendous ability to create, market, and sell their products (drugs/devices). The FDA system has done tremendous good for the world: It has enabled decades of medical innovation, resulting in billions of lives improved/saved, trillions in market growth, and millions of jobs created.
              <br><br>
              We hope to become a similar authority for products that today lie outside the purview of the FDA, and thus cannot be lent its authority. The FDA's process, while incredibly effective once products pass through, is incredibly burdensome, both in cost and in logistics/effort- and simply doesn't work for many types of products. Medicines that go through the FDA process often have one main characteristic: They are compositionally simple (and consistently so), often only containing 1-3 types of active molecules (not counting inert fillers). Most plant- and fungi-derived products contain dozens, if not hundreds, of different molecules, often in varying relative concentrations. Because of this variance, the FDA can't directly approve products that go to market (nor do most producers/cultivators/processors have the resources to go through the process anyways- the scales simply don't align). Thus, there is an enormous part of the healthcare sector that has been essentially deprived of product legitimacy simply because the products' innate characteristics simply don't align with existing methods of transferring authority. Consumers, despite wanting alternatives to the traditional Big Pharma-Driven system, struggle with taking natural products at face value because there’s no process like the FDA’s to verify their legitimacy. Until Now.
              <br><br>
              The products we work with are effective for humans because they are heterogeneous, but have to exist in the market in spite of them. We are going to flip that script.
